                The last century witnessed an unprecedented explosion in world population. Rising from approximately 1.6 billion people in 1900 to 6.8 billion people in 2010, this population increase has not been evenly divided geographically or socioeconomically. Furthermore, population growth is becoming increasingly concentrated in urban areas over time. The practical implications of this growth are immense: While wealthy developed nations have been able to finance the necessary infrastructure to accept growing populations, extremely poor nations are rarely in a position to do so. Even still, economic opportunities in rural areas are extremely limited and people continue to flock to the slums of the megacities in search of higher wages and access to water, food, and energy supplies.

                Urban slums face a wide range of challenges due to their unique set of circumstances. The intersection of excessive population density with the lack of necessary infrastructure leads to extreme waste production that has nowhere to go but giant waste dumps at the fringes of the city limits. Many people, desperate to make a living, resort to scavenging in these sites for recyclable materials (metals, plastics, glass, etc.) that can be sold to wholesalers.  Allowing organic material to sit and rot has its own negative health and environmental effects. but in order to make scavenging easier, the trash is frequently set on fire to eliminate the organic material from the co-mingled recyclables. Respiratory infections, illness, loss of sense of smell, and frequent burns to the hands and feet are commonly seen in these communities.

                In 2008, I was part of a team of Princeton and Rutgers students who wanted to find environmentally and financially-sustainable solutions for the waste scavengers who lived and worked in these sites.  Originally, we wanted to work with a community in Karachi, Pakistan to build a waste-to-energy biodigester that could be used to electrify the community.  Given the intense frequency of power outages throughout the city at the time, we envisioned that Phase 2 would see the creation of a full-fledged power plant that would sell electricity to the city at large.  We would incorporate the local community members at every level of the labor force for this power plant and profits would be used for community development.  Given that we would be mitigating methane emissions from these sites, we could even tap into carbon credits to further fund our system.  We had it all worked out!

                Well, we certainly had the idealism of university students looking to change the world.  We had a lot of great ideas and in the process, grew from a student group to a 501(c)3 non-profit.  We made connections with students in Pakistan who were exceptionally eager to raise awareness and help with our ground operations.  We worked with other NGOs in the area to conduct needs assessments and deliver small-scale supplies to the community.  We conducted art courses at a local school on the site that had been established with help from the Japanese embassy, and held fundraisers exhibiting the paintings to raise awareness and funds.  We entered - and won - several business plan competitions.  We rode on the coattails of enthusiasm, excitement, and idealism.  We were, in short, empowered.

                But eventually, after over 2 years of trying to work with the community in Karachi, we admitted to ourselves that the political landscape made it too challenging to continue.  We found a similar community in Dhaka and turned our attention there.  And then, we pivoted a second time, focusing on compost - rather than electricity - generation.  We built a waste-sorting area that would be safer and more comfortabe, while still allowing the community members to generate income from the composted organic waste.

                I left em[POWER] in 2011, just as the Dhaka project was getting off the ground, because I had to focus on writing up my thesis and finishing my PhD.  em[POWER] has pivoted and expanded its projects several times since then, and continues to work with communities all around the world.
