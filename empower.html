<div class="project-body-text">
<p>
Based on my experience in emerging markets and research involving numerous user studies with Android applications, I was asked to provide technical insights to a start-up mobile phone company, Soul, that was trying to enter the African market.  This was a different kind of company, one whose genesis was centered around the unique passions, environments, and needs of their customers.
</p>

<BR /><p>
Soul wasn't trying to directly compete with the top brands like Apple or Samsung.  But its founder saw that, particularly fueled by the accessibility of Android, a plethora of "Tier 2" companies were exceedingly popular in many of these markets because their price points were attainable.  This was despite the fact that these phones were often of poor build quality and the customers themselves may have preferred "original" models if they could afford them.
</p>
<img class="project-image-wrapper project-image" src="Photos/Research/Soul/Soul_002.jpg"/>
<div class="project-image-caption">Feature phone samples</div>
<BR /><p>
Many of these Tier 2 phones were manufactured through OEM suppliers in China.  This helps explain why so many phones look so similar across brands.  Soul therefore set out to differentiate itself through quality packaging and materials, software customizations, and marketing campaigns.  The company first entered Ghana with "generation 0" feature phones to establish a footing in the key supply chains of the country.  The next step was to introduce a line of Android smartphones, each with a different theme: in addition to the basic Soul Talk and music-centric Soul Symphony feature phones, the next generation of smartphones would include the Soul Control for business users and the flagship Soul Mate. 
</p>

<div class="project-image-caption">Customized packaging for the Generation 0 feature phones</div>
<BR /><p>
My role was to create a list of technical features to include in each design.  Because we were a small company, we resignedly realized that we would initally be bound to pre-determined OEM configurations because we couldn't meet minimum order quantities (MOQs) for fully customizable options.  I attended a few trade shows in Hong Kong and Shenzhen with the founder and we spoke to a number of suppliers.  We compared chipsets, hardware configurations, materials, designs, and more.  In order to maximize our identity, we also researched software apps, language support, ringtones, sticker/bracelet campaigns, and packaging designs.  
</p><BR /><p>
We were ready to pull the trigger on the order.. until Ghana abruptly introduced a new series of import taxes that would have significantly increased our costs and would have forced us to sell at a loss in order to be competitive.  As a new company, we simply couldn't afford the risk on the investment and reluctantly, we had to pull out.  But the company and concept still remain close to our hearts.. and souls.. to this day.
